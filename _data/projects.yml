    Designed and implemented Native <mark>OTF support</mark> in Teradata Vantage Core using <mark>C/C++</mark>
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Built the Table Properties module to parse metadata JSON and store it as a structured tree for downstream execution. Developed Manifest List/File processing modules to read Iceberg metadata, extract file and partition information, and pass it through the spool system for subsequent query steps. Integrated these components into the execution pipeline, improving metadata-driven filtering and enabling native reading of external tables.

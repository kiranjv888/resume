    At Teradata, I designed and implemented core system components in the Vantage Core database engine, focusing on native Open Table Format (OTF) integration and Delta Lake support. My work included building C/C++ modules for metadata parsing, manifest list/file processing, and table properties ingestion, enabling Vantage to interpret Iceberg metadata natively. I integrated these modules with Teradata's spool and execution pipeline so metadata could drive pruning, filtering, and downstream query operations. I also delivered Delta Lake ReadNOS capabilities, executing spike work for AWS, Azure, and GCP to validate transaction logs, schema evolution, and cloud object store compatibility. In addition to feature development, I resolved NOS-related stability issues, optimized metadata flows, and contributed to overall kernel reliability across lakehouse workloads.
